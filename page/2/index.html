					<a class="title" href="/posts/2020-7-15-weather/">Where I get my weather forecasts</a>
					<span class="description">
						
						<p>I&rsquo;ve been an Android user for the last 10 years, and for the last 3-4 years I&rsquo;ve been using the <a href="https://darksky.net/">Dark Sky</a> weather app.</p>
<p>However they recently announce they&rsquo;re <a href="https://blog.darksky.net/dark-sky-has-a-new-home/">shutting down the Android app</a>, so I&rsquo;ve been researching which weather services will fit my needs.</p>
<p>For near-term weather (the next 12-120 hours) I use the <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/">National Weather Service</a>, I especially like the <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=MPX&amp;issuedby=MPX&amp;product=AFD&amp;format=CI&amp;version=1&amp;glossary=1">Area Forcast Discussion</a> which is written a human, and gives insight and more color into the weather than just reading a 5 day forecast.</p>

					<a class="title" href="/posts/2020-7-5-flickr/">Flickr&#39;s Camera Finder</a>
					<span class="description">
						
						<p>It&rsquo;s a temptation in photography to ascribe gear like an expensive camera body or a fast n&rsquo; sharp lense as the the reason great photos are great.
As if the gear itself will propel my photos from &ldquo;ok&rdquo; to &ldquo;great&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One resource I&rsquo;ve found as a &ldquo;check&rdquo; against gear creep is <a href="https://www.flickr.com/cameras">Flickr&rsquo;s Camera Finder</a>. With this tool, I can filter photos by camera body.
As an example I have the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/cameras/olympus/e-m10markii/">Olympus&rsquo;s EM10 Mark II</a>, so I can find all the photos on Flickr taken with this body.</p>

					<span class="description">
						
						<p><a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a> (my preferred podcast player) says I&rsquo;ve listened to 1038 hours of audio since 2015.
This sounds like a lot, but per week it&rsquo;s only <code>1038 / 5 / 52</code> ~ 4 hours.
But it&rsquo;s the consistency that counts.</p>
<p>In this post I&rsquo;ll detail the podcasts I love and why.</p>
<h2 id="the-podcasts">The podcasts</h2>
<p><a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/">Conversations with Tyler</a> by far is the most engaging and stimulating for me.
It&rsquo;s a discussion format show, where Tyler interviews different notable individuals each episode.
I value thoughtful and engaging questions in interviews, and Tyler provides.
I only discovered the show in the last 6 months, and I&rsquo;m catching up. The format is economist Tyler Cowen interviews a wide variety of intellectuals covering a wide range of topics.
Tyler specializes in pointed and rapid fire questions, it is clear he spends much time preparing.</p>

					<span class="description">
						
						<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that my experience with macOS/OSX only goes back a few years, but I was instantly frustrated with window management.
Most folks around me seemed to have a sea of small windows that would pile up over the course of a day, maybe they would use mission control to switch between windows.</p>
<p>But for tasks where two windows were needed at the same time (for example side by side), most folks were content enough to simply drag and resize windows into place.
This seemed insane.</p>

					<span class="description">
						
						<p>When I&rsquo;m looking at property, one of the additional research steps I take is figuring out the available internet providers.</p>
<p>Initially I would Google something like &ldquo;internet options at address&rdquo; and some site like <em>highspeedinternet.com</em> or <em>broadbandnow.com</em> would pop up.
These sites are <em>fine</em>, but have ads and are definitely funnels to get you to sign up for something.</p>
<p>And then I found <a href="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/">broadbandmap.fcc.gov</a>, which gives per census block internet provider data.</p>

					<a class="title" href="/posts/2020-5-27-lightroom/">How I manage my Lightroom library</a>
					<span class="description">
						
						<p>After I bought a <a href="https://www.getolympus.com/us/en/e-m10-mark-ii.html">mirrorless micro four thirds camera</a> last year, I&rsquo;ve entered the rabbit whole of media management.</p>
<p>I started by shooting in JPEG and dumping the images I liked into Google Photos, simple enough, right?
After a while, for various reasons, I started shooting in RAW.
But after filling my first SD card full of RAW files, I realized I needed a way to process them.</p>
<p>Lightroom seems to be the default choice, so I went with that.
I know there are open source alternatives like <a href="https://www.darktable.org/">Darktable</a>, but I haven&rsquo;t invested much time into exploring it.</p>

						<p>If you&rsquo;re a <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> user, you may have seen this image
<img src="/images/todoist.png#responsive" alt="">
Even if you haven&rsquo;t, the style may look familiar.
<a href="https://www.are.na/claire-l-evans/corporate-memphis">100s (1000s?) of organizations use the same style</a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://qz.com/quartzy/1728767/why-editorial-illustrations-look-so-similar-these-days/">Quartz article</a> elaborates more on the trend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s most widely referred to as “flat illustration” or, pejoratively, “Corporate Memphis,” alluding to its frequent appearance in ads and interfaces for tech companies like Lyft, Spotify, Oscar, Airtable, and many others.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How did this style come to define today’s illustration practice?  The answer boils down to three T’s: technology, taste, and terrible pay.</p>

					<a class="title" href="/posts/2020-5-19-craigslist/">Craigslist search operators</a>
					<span class="description">
						
						<p>I&rsquo;m currently searching for a second vehicle and have been trolling Craigslist postings.
I have <a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/saved_searches_and_alerts">saved searches</a> set up, but was receiving a lot of false positives because nothing stops unrelated postings from keyword stuffing.</p>
<p>I found that Craigslist has surprising robust <a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/help/search">search operators</a>.</p>
<p>For example, I used this search:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>hybrid -truck -.com -ford -buick -dodge -chrysler -hyundai -lincoln -kia -cadillac
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;m looking for a <code>hybrid</code>, and don&rsquo;t want any post with <code>truck</code> or various manufacturers or <code>.com</code> (which is typically a dealer, I&rsquo;m looking for a private seller).</p>

					<span class="description">
						
						<p>Since working from home, I&rsquo;ve been using an external monitor more heavily.
The light in my office changes throughout the day, and I found myself adjusting the brightness on my Macbook and external monitor separately.</p>
<p>I started looking for a utility that would link the brightness of the MBP and my external monitor, and I found <a href="https://lunar.fyi/">Lunar</a>.</p>
<p>In sync mode, the brightness of the laptop and external monitor are linked, which means I only need to adjust one brightness level for both.</p>
