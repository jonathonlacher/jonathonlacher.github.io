			<p>This is the first in a series of posts of my notes on the book <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> by John Ousterhout.</p>
<p>Most of my notes are loosely copied quotes, paraphrases, or summaries of my understanding.
I&rsquo;ve included the page number (from my edition) in parentheses.</p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<ol>
<li>The greatest limitation in writing software is our ability to understand the systems we are creating. (1)</li>
<li>There are two approaches to fighting complexity.
<ol>
<li>Eliminate complexity by making code simpler and more obvious. (2)</li>
<li>Encapsulate it, so you can work on the system without being exposed to all the complexity at once (2)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Book as two goals: (3)
<ol>
<li>Describe the nature of software complexity, what does &ldquo;complexity&rdquo; mean, why does it matter, how can you recognize it?</li>
<li>Present techniques you can use to help minimize complexity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Best way to use this book is in conjunction with code reviews. (4)</li>
<li>Good way to improve design skills to to learn go recognize red flags (4)</li>
<li>Moderation and discretion is important. Everything has limits, don&rsquo;t take the ideas in this book to the extreme. (4)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<ol>
<li>Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify. (5)</li>
<li>Complexity is more apparent to readers than writers. (6)</li>
<li>Symptoms of complexity:
<ol>
<li>Change amplification: A seemingly simple change requires modifications in many places. (7)</li>
<li>Cognitive load: An engineer needs to spend a lot more time learning and needs to hold much more info in their mind to make the change. Complexity isn&rsquo;t measured in the number of lines; sometimes the more verbose version of code is simpler because it&rsquo;s not trying to be clever. (7)</li>
<li>Unknown unknowns: When it&rsquo;s not obvious what pieces of code must be modified to complete a task or even what info is needed to complete the task. This is the worst symptom, since you only find out about it after something unknown rears its head. (9)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Causes of complexity:
<ol>
<li>Dependencies
<ol>
<li>A dep exists when a piece of code can&rsquo;t be understood and modified in isolation. (9)</li>
<li>Deps can&rsquo;t be eliminated, but we can be intentional.</li>
<li>Two goals of software design: (10)
1. Reduce the number of deps
2. Make deps that remain simple and obvious</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Obscurity
<ol>
<li>Occurs when important information is not obvious.</li>
<li>Obscurity is often associated with deps, where it&rsquo;s not obvious that a dep exists. (10)</li>
<li>Inconsistency is also a major contributor to obscurity.</li>
<li>The need for extensive docs is often a red flag that the design isn&rsquo;t good.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Complexity isn&rsquo;t caused by a single terrible error, but accumulates in small chunks over time. (11)</li>
<li>Once complexity has accumulated, it&rsquo;s hard to eliminate since fixing any one issue won&rsquo;t make a big difference. (11)</li>
<li>In order to slow the growth of complexity, we must have a zero tolerance approach.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>
<ol>
<li>Tactical programming is the mindset of only getting something working, nothing else is considered. (13)</li>
<li>The problem with tactical programming is it&rsquo;s short sighted. The accumulation of just trying to introduce a new feature or fix a bug introduces complexity and kludges, which is how systems get complicated. (13)</li>
<li>Once you start taking the tactical approach, it&rsquo;s difficult to change. (14)</li>
<li>Tactical tornado: A prolific programmer who pumps out code faster than others but in a totally tactical fashion. They may be admired by management, but they leave a wake of destruction and messes that other engineers must clean up. (14)</li>
<li>Strategic programming: Working code isn&rsquo;t enough. The most important thing is the long-term structure of the system. Your primary goal is to produce a great design which also happens to work. (14)</li>
<li>Strategic programming requires an investment mindset. Rather than taking the shortest and fastest path to finishing something, you must invest time to improve the design of the system. (15)</li>
<li>Continually make small improvements to system design: (15)
<ol>
<li>Iterate on a design, don&rsquo;t use the first one you think of.</li>
<li>Imagine a few ways a system might need to be changed in the future and make sure the current design makes this easy.</li>
<li>Write good documentation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Big upfront investments in design don&rsquo;t work, this is waterfall. The best approach is lots of small investments on a continual basis. (15)</li>
<li>Suggestion: spend 10%-20% of total development time on investments. While you make take 10-20% longer at first, these will pay off in the long-run and future changes will be easier. (15-16)</li>
<li>Once a codebase is spaghetti, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to fix. (17)</li>
<li>The most important factor of success in a company is the quality of its engineers. The best engineers care deeply about good design. (17)</li>
<li>Once you start delaying design improvements, it&rsquo;s easy for delays to become permanent and your culture will slip into the tactical approach. (18)</li>
</ol>
