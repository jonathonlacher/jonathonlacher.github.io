<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>We have tried to duplicate mill glaze failure in the laboratory. The tests have included planing lumber with dull blades at high feed pressures. We have been unable to obtain a “glazed” surface. This does not necessarily mean that mill glaze cannot happen; it means that we have not been able to duplicate it in the laboratory. Although research on “mill glaze” effect has not continued at FPL, we did investigate a number of reported mill glaze failures. In all cases, the failures were readily explained by other failure mechanisms, including raised grain, degradation of the wood surface by ultraviolet (UV) radiation prior to painting, insufficient thickness of the coating system, improper surface preparation, and moisture problems.</p></blockquote>
