Although research on “mill glaze” effect has not continued at FPL, we did investigate a number of reported mill glaze failures. In all cases, the failures were readily explained by other failure mechanisms, including raised grain, degradation of the wood surface by ultraviolet (UV) radiation prior to painting, insufficient thickness of the coating system, improper surface preparation, and moisture problems.\n— Mark Knaebe, USDA Forest Service, Mill Glaze: Myth or Reality?\n","date":"2025-02-12","description":"I built a wood fence this past summer, and the stain I used made a big deal about mill glaze.

(13) The problem with tactical programming is it\u0026rsquo;s short sighted. The accumulation of just trying to introduce a new feature or fix a bug introduces complexity and kludges, which is how systems get complicated. (13) Once you start taking the tactical approach, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to change. (14) Tactical tornado: A prolific programmer who pumps out code faster than others but in a totally tactical fashion. They may be admired by management, but they leave a wake of destruction and messes that other engineers must clean up. (14) Strategic programming: Working code isn\u0026rsquo;t enough. The most important thing is the long-term structure of the system. Your primary goal is to produce a great design which also happens to work. (14) Strategic programming requires an investment mindset. Rather than taking the shortest and fastest path to finishing something, you must invest time to improve the design of the system. (15) Continually make small improvements to system design: (15) Iterate on a design, don\u0026rsquo;t use the first one you think of. Imagine a few ways a system might need to be changed in the future and make sure the current design makes this easy. Write good documentation. Big upfront investments in design don\u0026rsquo;t work, this is waterfall. The best approach is lots of small investments on a continual basis. (15) Suggestion: spend 10%-20% of total development time on investments. While you make take 10-20% longer at first, these will pay off in the long-run and future changes will be easier. (15-16) Once a codebase is spaghetti, it\u0026rsquo;s nearly impossible to fix. (17) The most important factor of success in a company is the quality of its engineers. The best engineers care deeply about good design. (17) Once you start delaying design improvements, it\u0026rsquo;s easy for delays to become permanent and your culture will slip into the tactical approach.

I also have a three zone Mitsubishi mini-split system, with two zones upstairs and one on the main floor. The upstairs also has electric baseboard heat in all rooms.\nUnderstanding which sources of heat to use this winter is a challenge. The mini-split can be an effective heat source compared to electric baseboard heat, but the efficiency depends on the outside temp and how much heat each indoor unit is requesting. My understanding is that mini-splits are most efficient when running on low. This means setting large setbacks temps at night could actually end up using more electricity than keeping the temp constant.\nHowever, there are other factors that can affect this. Depending on how insulated and air sealed my house is, constantly heating with the minis-splits could be cost-ineffective if my house is a leaky sieve.\nElectric baseboard heat should be my last option, and when it\u0026amp;rsquo;s below ~5 F outside, it\u0026amp;rsquo;s my only option for the upstairs, as my mini-split can\u0026amp;rsquo;t heat below that temp (newer models can operate another 15-20 degrees below that).\nOne of the better resources I\u0026amp;rsquo;ve found on heating using minis-splits is a report prepared for the U.S Department of Energy, Long-Term Monitoring of Mini-Split Ductless Heat Pumps in the Northeast.\nTemperature setbacks are not an effective strategy with MSHPs: when temperatures are set up, the unit runs at maximum capacity (and lowest efficiency) to return to set point temperature.\nThe report is over 120 pages long, many interesting observations. However I am cautious about immediately applying all of their recommendations as my house is not as well insulated as the studied houses, and I also have the main floor boiler heat system.\nI\u0026amp;rsquo;m still new to this heating thing, I only have one partial month of utility usage billed.

This sounds like a lot, but per week it\u0026amp;rsquo;s only 1038 / 5 / 52 ~ 4 hours. But it\u0026amp;rsquo;s the consistency that counts.\nIn this post I\u0026amp;rsquo;ll detail the podcasts I love and why.\nThe podcasts Conversations with Tyler by far is the most engaging and stimulating for me. It\u0026amp;rsquo;s a discussion format show, where Tyler interviews different notable individuals each episode. I value thoughtful and engaging questions in interviews, and Tyler provides. I only discovered the show in the last 6 months, and I\u0026amp;rsquo;m catching up. The format is economist Tyler Cowen interviews a wide variety of intellectuals covering a wide range of topics. Tyler specializes in pointed and rapid fire questions, it is clear he spends much time preparing.\nI\u0026amp;rsquo;ve been listening to Econtalk since 2010, and episodes go back to 2007. Hosted by economist Russ Roberts who also interviews a range of guests. Relatively structured format, Russ spends much time preparing by reading relevant books, papers, and posts by the guest which informs the questions he asks. New episodes every Monday, and has released weekly for as long as I remember. Russ has been instrumental in helping me adapt a framework for thinking about many issues.\nLongform Podcast, interviews with writers, often about their journey, including past experiences and the mechanics of writing. Generally delves into the specifics of guests\u0026amp;rsquo; latest or most prominent work.\nOn the Metal is a newcomer to my rotation. Hosted by Bryan Cantrill (of always be hustlin\u0026amp;rsquo; fame) and Jess Frazelle. Longer formed, more free flowing conversations with important folks from computing history. The guests and topics are usually a bit outside my normal tech wheelhouse but, but that\u0026amp;rsquo;s a feature, not a bug.\nI\u0026amp;rsquo;m a recent subscriber to Stratechery, a daily newsletter by Ben Thompson focusing mainly on analysis of technology news. Ben recently launched a podcast where he reads his daily newsletter, which is why it\u0026amp;rsquo;s on this list. I appreciate his insights, however I\u0026amp;rsquo;m still in an evaluating phase if I value the content enough to continue paying. I do support his model of directly paying a creator for their work (no ads!).\nAnother Ben Tompson podcast, Exponent, with co-host James Allworth is in the general wheelhouse of Stratechery, though more focussed on the societal (human) interactions with technology. Often frequent overlaps with context from Stratechery. The format is a less structured conversation, with either one of the hosts taking the lead on any given week.\nThe YCombinator Podcast was on a roll until January of 2020, but have not released an episode since. Structured interviews, mainly with tech and startup oriented individuals.\nI would liken Acquired to a more in depth, startup focused \u0026amp;ldquo;How I Build This\u0026amp;rdquo;. Episodes run 1.5+ hours, and are hosted by Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal.

This seemed insane.\nI then stumbled upon Spectacle which uses keyboard shortcuts like alt + cmd + right arrow to move/resize a window to the right half of the screen. This app worked great. It is no longer under active development however, Rectangle seems to be the most recommended replacement. I literally use it dozens of times a day.\nIt\u0026amp;rsquo;s neat, you should try it.\n","date":"2020-06-26","description":"I\u0026rsquo;ll admit that my experience with macOS/OSX only goes back a few years, but I was instantly frustrated with window management.

After a while, for various reasons, I started shooting in RAW. But after filling my first SD card full of RAW files, I realized I needed a way to process them.\nLightroom seems to be the default choice, so I went with that. I know there are open source alternatives like Darktable, but I haven\u0026amp;rsquo;t invested much time into exploring it.\nRatings I cull my photos in waves. I first mark for deletion any photo that I consider throwaway; such as the focus is off, or I shot a dozen photos in rapid succession and I know I won\u0026amp;rsquo;t even consider a few of them.\nThen I start staring my photos. I\u0026amp;rsquo;ll give any viable photo 1 star. Then I\u0026amp;rsquo;ll go through all the 1 star photos and give 2 stars. If there are enough photos, I\u0026amp;rsquo;ll repeat for 3 stars, and on rare occasions 4 stars.\nDeveloping I won\u0026amp;rsquo;t touch on my editing process right now, that\u0026amp;rsquo;s a whole separate skill which I\u0026amp;rsquo;m still learning. But in terms of order of operations, only after culling my photos through ratings will I start developing and editing them.\nExporting After I\u0026amp;rsquo;ve developed my photos, I\u0026amp;rsquo;ll export them to a more usable format like JPEG. I found a great Lightroom plugin called Jeffrey’s “Folder Publisher” Lightroom Plugin which can export JPEGs in the same directory hierarchy that you store your RAW files.\nFor example, I store my RAW files as such:\nraw_photos/ ├── 2020-5-20/ │ ├── img223.raw │ ├── img224.raw │ └── img225.raw └──2020-5-23/ ├── img228.raw └── img229.raw The plugin on execution will export JPEGs as follows:\nexported_photos/ ├── 2020-5-20/ │ ├── img223.jpg │ ├── img224.jpg │ └── img225.jpg └──2020-5-23/ ├── img228.jpg └── img229.jpg I\u0026amp;rsquo;ll typically export to JPEG photos with 2 stars or higher.
